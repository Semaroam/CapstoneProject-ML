It is capable of categorizing queries into three main intents: **small_talk**, **faq**, and **recommender** intent. This model is particularly useful for building chatbot systems or natural language processing (NLP) applications that assist users in finding information and recommendations about traveling in Bali.
### Model used:
* A Lite BERT (AlBERT) for embedding layer
* CNN, MaxPooling1D, and Dense for classifier layer

## Named Entity Recognition
Training a custom NER model that can identify entities such as **attractions_preferences**, **hotels_preferences**, **food_preferences**, and **region** that are relevant to travel in Bali.
### Model used:
* spaCy NER

## Recommender Systems (content-based)
Building a content-based recommender system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. Content-based recommenders suggest items to users based on the similarity between the content/features of items and the user's preferences.
### Model used:
* TF-IDF for vectorizer
* Cosine similarity for similarity matching
