<h2>A machine learning model build with ALBERT Embedding, CNN Classifier, and POS NER to Recommends Items</h2>
<p>Hi. this is our repository for our project in capstone project Bangkit 2024 Batch 1. Our team consist of 3 people from Machine Learning Path.

All of the project management we take a place with Github repository, to distinguish each path we create a different repository.</p>
